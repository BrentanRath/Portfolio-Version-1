A personal bio-link portfolio website featuring a dynamic stats display and social media links. This was originally developed by myself and has been restored from an earlier project. I have made this repository public as it was private prior in an attempt to create a timeline of my progress.

The site features a clean, centered design with a custom background image, profile picture, and a statistics grid displaying GitHub metrics. It uses vanilla JavaScript to fetch and display repository and commit data from a JSON file, creating an interactive portfolio landing page with smooth hover effects and responsive design.

This project demonstrates my understanding of HTML/CSS layout, DOM manipulation, and creating visually appealing single-page applications.
